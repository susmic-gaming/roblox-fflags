#How to use:
 Install BloxStrap and then open Roblox FFLAG Hack.exe. 
 - for it to run you have to disable your antivirus (eg. mcafee, malwarebytes, windows defender,) when you are using the app because it replaces the
fflags in the roblox root directory when a file is clicked so when restarted applys the changes to
your game. If you are wondering, The app does not use lua code.
